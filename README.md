#  PHP(Symfony) JS(Vuejs) 

Soo my boss decided  that our next SaaS should be in the stack PHP Symfony with a front-end technology that uses Javascript Vue.js Library (Yep atleast one decision that makes sense)  , don't ask me why PHP im not the decision maker.
After hours online trying to look for a tutorial that integrated both stacks, i found a few that tried to but werent up to date and werent fully integration both technologies to the fullest, Inspired by a few tutorials i decided to make my own just incase anybody found themself in the same situation and need some guidlines on how to integrate them.
This isnt a full project with an ORM, a database or  business logic just a small setup so that both technology can speak between them.
 It doesnt require a intermediate understanding of both stack to go thru the tutorial but to be able to move forward with the skeleton and uses for a specific business an understand of both stacks is without a question.
